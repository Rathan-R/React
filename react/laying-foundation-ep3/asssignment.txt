what is npm
npm is standard repository for all the packages and npm is not abbrevated as the node package manager it manages all the packages so it is called as the node package manager.

what is parcer/webPack
these are bundelers that are used to do the production ready applications

what is .parcel-cache
parcel-cache` is a directory generated by the Parcel bundler, serving as a cache for storing intermediate build results. It enhances the development workflow by speeding up subsequent builds and optimizing resource usage.


what is npx 
NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it. NPX is installed automatically with NPM

what is dependencies and devdependencies
A dependency is a library that a project needs to function effectively. DevDependencies are the packages a developer needs during development

What is treeShaking 
it is feature of parcel it basically removes unused codes in the production ready applications.
tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code.

What is Hot Module Replacement
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) improves the development experience by automatically updating modules in the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh. This means that application state can be retained as you change small things

differential bundling--->Parcel automatically generates a nomodule fallback for old browsers as well, depending on your browser targets.This results in much smaller bundles for a majority of users in modern browsers, while still supporting older browsers as well!

whart is gitignore
it is used to put the files which are need not to be uploaded to the github repository
we should add the files which can be recreated by package.json example node_modules
The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git remain untracked. To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, use git rm --cached to remove the file from the index. The filename can then be added to the . gitignore file to stop the file from being reintroduced in later commits.

difference btwn 'package.json' and 'packagelock.json'
package.json-->it is file that contains all the configrations for the npm.if we mention the caret symbol in the versions if there is an minor upgrade that will be updated if there is tilt symn=bol mentioned then the major updates will be updated
packagelock.json----->it will contain the exact versions of all the dependencies that that have been installed by the npm
package.json: This file is primarily used for managing and documenting metadata about the project, including its name, version, author, dependencies, scripts, and other configuration details. It acts as a manifest for the project.
package-lock.json: This file is generated and updated automatically by npm when installing or updating packages. It is used to lock the exact versions of dependencies installed in the project, ensuring reproducibility and consistent installations across different environments.

Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`
The package-lock.json file in a Node.js project is automatically generated and is intended to be a complete and exact record of the versions of all dependencies, including sub-dependencies, that your project depends on. It is used by npm to produce a deterministic and reproducible build.
If you need to update a package or manage dependencies, it's recommended to use npm commands like npm install <package> or update the package.json file and then run npm install. This ensures that the package-lock.json file is updated automatically while maintaining consistency and reproducibility in your project.

what are node_modules
The node_modules folder is a folder that is created when you install packages using the Node Package Manager (npm). It stores the packages and their dependencies that your project requires.
we need not push this into git because it can be recreated buy the package.json itself.

what is dist folder
the parcel budles our code,where your code gets bundled to for use in its “production” environment

what is browsers list
it can be used to give the versions of browsers.it can be mentionedin the package.json
